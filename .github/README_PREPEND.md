A fork of [horselock/Jailbreaks](https://github.com/horselock/Jailbreaks.git) repo with normalized filenames so that it's possible to clone/pull in Windows PCs.

- Only the filenames are normalized so they are compatible with Windows (can't contain `?`, `|`, `<`, `>`, etc). The content isn't touched at all.
- Any character that's not `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_` or `.` is removed/converted via a GitHub workflow that runs every day at 2 AM.
- Filenames ending with `.` and no extension have the dot removed.

##### *PS: If you're gonna star a repo, please star the [original one](https://github.com/CyberAlbSecOP/Awesome_GPT_Super_Prompting.git).*
